      The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The novel virus was first
      identified in an outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. Attempts to contain it there failed,
      allowing the virus to spread to other areas of Asia and later worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO)
      declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020, and began
      referring to it as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The WHO ended its PHEIC declaration on 5 May 2023, but as of 2
      June 2023 continues to refer to it as a pandemic. Prior to this, some countries had already begun to regard
      COVID-19 as an endemic disease. As of 18 July 2023, the pandemic had caused 767,972,197 cases and
      6,950,642 confirmed deaths, ranking it fifth in the deadliest epidemics and pandemics in history. <br><br>

      The first cases of COVID-19 in India were reported on 30 January 2020 in three towns of Kerala, among three Indian
      medical students who had returned from Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic.Lockdowns were announced in Kerala on
      23 March, and in the rest of the country on 25 March. Infection rates started to drop in September. Daily cases
      peaked mid-September with over 90,000 cases reported per-day, dropping to below 15,000 in January 2021. A second
      wave beginning in March 2021 was much more devastating than the first, with shortages of vaccines, hospital beds,
      oxygen cylinders and other medical supplies in parts of the country. By late April, India led the world in new and
      active cases. On 30 April 2021, it became the first country to report over 400,000 new cases in a 24-hour period.
      Experts stated that the virus may reach an endemic stage in India rather than completely disappear; in late August
      2021, Soumya Swaminathan said India may be in some stage of endemicity where the country learns to live with the
      virus. <br><br>

      The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005 was invoked in mid-March 2020.All commercial
      domestic and international flights were suspended in March. A number of cities and states announced that they
      would restrict public gatherings, dine-in restaurants, or order the closure of various non-essential businesses
      through 31 March to slow the spread of COVID-19. On 19 March 2020, Prime Minister Modi asked all Indians to
      observe a 14-hour Janata curfew ("people's curfew") on 22 March, and to thank essential workers by clapping or
      ringing bells at 5 p.m. outside their homes. The curfew was used to evaluate the feasibility of a national
      lockdown. <br><br>
      On 24 March, with 519 confirmed cases and 9 deaths in the country, the Prime Minister announced that India would
      be placed under a "total lockdown" for at least three weeks. All non-critical businesses and services were ordered
      closed except for hospitals, grocery stores, and pharmacies, and there was a "total ban" on leaving the home for
      non-essential purposes. All public transport was suspended. <br><br>
      On 16 April, districts were divided into zones using a colour-coded tier system based on incidence rates,
      classified as a "Red" (hotspot), "Orange", or "Green" (little to no transmission) zone. All of India's major
      cities fell into Red zones. Beginning 20 April, agricultural businesses and stores selling farming supplies were
      allowed to resume operation, as well as public works programmes, cargo transport, and banks and government centres
      distributing benefits.Phase 3 and 4 of the lockdown extended until 31 May, with incremental relaxations and
      changes. The country began a phased lifting of restrictions on 8 June.This phased lifting of restrictions
      continued in a series of "unlocks" which extended into November 2020. <br><br>

      India began its vaccination programme on 16 January 2021 with AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield) and the indigenous
      Covaxin. Later, Sputnik V and the Moderna vaccine was approved for emergency use too. On January 30, 2022,
      India announced that it administered about 1.7 billion doses of vaccines and more than 720 million people were
      fully vaccinated.The Indian government infused ₹900 crore (equivalent to ₹11 billion or US$130 million in 2023)
      into the Department of Biotechnology in November 2020 to aid the development of a COVID vaccine. The 2021
      budget of India also allocated ₹35,000 crore (equivalent to ₹410 billion or US$5.1 billion in 2023) for vaccine
      procurement. <br><br>

      In January 2021, the DCGI initially approved the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute
      of India (SII) under the trade name "Covishield",and BBV152 (Covaxin), a vaccine developed by Bharat
      Biotech in association with the Indian Council of Medical Research and National Institute of Virology. <br><br>

      The approval of Covaxin was met with some concern, as the vaccine had not then completed phase 3 trials. Due
      to this status, those receiving Covaxin were required to sign a consent form, while some states chose to
      relegate Covaxin to a "buffer stock" and primarily distribute the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine. Following the
      conclusion of its trial, the DCGI issued a standard emergency-use authorisation to Covaxin in March 2021. The
      slogan 'Dawai Bhi, Kadai Bhi' (trnsl; Vaccination and Precautions both are necessary) was used by the Indian
      Government. <br><br>
